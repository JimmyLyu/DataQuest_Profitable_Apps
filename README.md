<font size='5'>**DataQuest Guided Project: Profitable App Profiles in the App Market**</font>




<font size='4'>**Objectives**</font>


This is a guided project from DataQuest.

Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets.

For this project, we'll pretend we're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and the App Store.


At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
